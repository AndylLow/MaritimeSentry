\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
The Istanbul Bosphorus strait serves as one of the world's busiest maritime passages, connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean through the Sea of Marmara. With over 50,000 vessels passing through annually, including cargo ships, tankers, ferries, and recreational boats, effective maritime surveillance has become crucial for safety, security, and environmental protection.

Traditional maritime monitoring relies heavily on radar systems and human observation, which can be limited by weather conditions, visibility, and human error. The advancement of computer vision and deep learning technologies presents new opportunities for automated vessel detection and tracking systems.

\section{Problem Statement}
Current maritime surveillance systems face several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited accuracy in detecting small vessels in complex maritime environments
    \item High false positive rates due to environmental factors (waves, reflections, weather)
    \item Difficulty in real-time processing of high-resolution imagery
    \item Lack of accessible, user-friendly interfaces for maritime authorities
    \item Need for systems that can distinguish between different vessel types
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
The primary objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a web-based ship detection system using state-of-the-art YOLO technology
    \item Implement advanced computer vision techniques for improved maritime detection accuracy
    \item Create a user-friendly interface for image upload and result visualization
    \item Optimize detection parameters specifically for Bosphorus maritime conditions
    \item Provide comprehensive performance analysis and benchmarking
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Computer Vision in Maritime Applications}
Computer vision applications in maritime surveillance have evolved significantly over the past decade. Early approaches relied primarily on traditional image processing techniques such as edge detection, morphological operations, and template matching. However, these methods often struggled with the dynamic nature of maritime environments.

Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized object detection in maritime contexts. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in identifying and classifying vessels under various environmental conditions.

\section{YOLO Architecture Evolution}
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture represents a paradigm shift in object detection, offering real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy. The evolution from YOLOv1 to YOLOv8 has brought significant improvements:

\subsection{YOLOv1-v3}
Early YOLO versions established the foundation for single-shot detection, introducing concepts of grid-based prediction and anchor boxes.

\subsection{YOLOv4-v5}
These versions improved accuracy through enhanced data augmentation, optimized architectures, and better training strategies.

\subsection{YOLOv8}
The latest iteration features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved backbone network architecture
    \item Enhanced feature pyramid networks
    \item Better multi-scale detection capabilities
    \item Optimized for both accuracy and speed
\end{itemize}

\section{Maritime-Specific Challenges}
Maritime object detection presents unique challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable lighting conditions (dawn, dusk, overcast)
    \item Water surface reflections and glare
    \item Wave motion and sea state variations
    \item Diverse vessel types and sizes
    \item Partial occlusion by waves or other vessels
